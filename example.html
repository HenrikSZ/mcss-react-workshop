            This course introduces students to the principles of computer
            programming and to the basic techniques for writing programs using a
            high-level programming language. It also introduces students to the
            design and analysis of algorithms, the structure of computer systems,
            and the nature of computer science.

            CSC207H5 is a course that focuses on software development and introduces students to
            Java and the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC). In this course, students will
            learn the fundamentals of Java programming, including object-oriented programming
            concepts and techniques. They will also gain an understanding of the SDLC, which
            encompasses the processes and methodologies used in developing software applications.
            Through hands-on projects and assignments, students will have the opportunity to apply
            their knowledge and develop real-world software solutions. By the end of the course,
            students will have a solid foundation in Java programming and a comprehensive understanding
            of the software development process.

            CSC236H5 is an introduction to the theory of computation. This course covers topics such as
            proving program correctness, runtime analysis, and finite automata. Students will learn
            about the theoretical foundations of computation and gain the skills to analyze and design
            algorithms. Through lectures, assignments, and projects, students will develop a deep
            understanding of the principles and techniques used in the theory of computation. By the end
            of the course, students will be equipped with the knowledge and tools to reason about the
            correctness and efficiency of programs, as well as to recognize and solve computational
            problems using formal models.
